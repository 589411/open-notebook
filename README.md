# Open Notebook

An open source, privacy-focused alternative to Google's Notebook LM. Why give Google more of our data when we can take control of our own research workflows?

In a world dominated by Artificial Intelligence, having the ability to think üß† and acquire new knowledge üí°, is a skill that should not be a privilege for a few, nor restricted to a single company.

Open Notebook empowers you to manage your research, generate AI-assisted notes, and interact with your content‚Äîon your terms.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up

Go to the [Setup Guide](docs/SETUP.md) to learn how to set up the tool in details.

But, the gist of it is: 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lfnovo/open_notebook.git
cd open_notebook
cp .env.sample .env
poetry install
poetry run streamlit run app_home.py
```

or with docker:

```yaml
services:
  surrealdb:
    image: surrealdb/surrealdb:v2
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./surreal-data:/mydata
    user: "${UID}:${GID}"
    command: start --log trace --user root --pass root rocksdb:mydatabase.db
    pull_policy: always
  open_notebook:
    image: lfnovo/open_notebook:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8502"
    volumes:
      - ./docker.env:/app/.env
    depends_on:
      - surrealdb
    pull_policy: always
```
