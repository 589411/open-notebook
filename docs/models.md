This guide helps you choose the best AI models for your Open Notebook setup. We'll cover what makes each provider special, which models work best for different tasks, and give you ready-to-use combinations to get started quickly.

## Understanding Model Types

**üéØ Quality**: Higher quality models often cost more but produce better results
**‚ö° Speed**: Smaller models are faster but may be less capable
**üîß Features**: Some models excel at specific tasks like tool calling or large contexts
