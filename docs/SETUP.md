# Configuration and Setup

## Installing Open Notebook

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Be sure to edit the `.env` file before running the app.

### üê≥ Docker Setup (recommended)

We recommend using Docker as this will get you all the services installed and configured with no hassle.

Copy the `.env.example` file and name it `docker.env`

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  surrealdb:
    image: surrealdb/surrealdb:v2
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - surreal_data:/mydata
    command: start --log trace --user root --pass root rocksdb:/mydata/mydatabase.db
    pull_policy: always
    user: root

  open_notebook:
    image: lfnovo/open-notebook:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8502"
    env_file:
      - ./docker.env
    depends_on:
      - surrealdb
    pull_policy: always
    volumes:
      - notebook_data:/app/data

volumes:
  surreal_data:
  notebook_data:
```

or with the environment variables:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  surrealdb:
    image: surrealdb/surrealdb:v2
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - surreal_data:/mydata
    command: start --log trace --user root --pass root rocksdb:/mydata/mydatabase.db
    pull_policy: always
    user: root

  open_notebook:
    image: lfnovo/open-notebook:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8502"
    environment:
        - OPENAI_API_KEY=API_KEY
        - DEFAULT_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
        - SURREAL_ADDRESSsurrealdb
        - SURREAL_PORT=8000
        - SURREAL_USER=root
        - SURREAL_PASS=root
        - SURREAL_NAMESPACE=open_notebook
        - SURREAL_DATABASE=staging
    depends_on:
      - surrealdb
    pull_policy: always
    volumes:
      - notebook_data:/app/data

volumes:
  surreal_data:
  notebook_data:
```

### üì¶ Installing from Source

If you really want to play with the source code.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lfnovo/open_notebook.git
cd open_notebook
poetry install
cp .env.example .env
poetry run streamlit run app_home.py
```

Run the app with: 

```sh
poetry run streamlit run app_home.py
```

or the shourcut

```sh
make run
```

## Setting up the providers

Several new providers are supported now:

- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- Open Router
- LiteLLM
- Vertex AI
- Gemini
- Ollama

All providers are installed out of the box. All you need to do is to setup the environment variable configurations (API Keys, etc) for your selected provider and decide which models to use. 

Please refer to the `.env.example` file for instructions on which ENV variables are necessary for each. 

### Use provider-modelname convention

You should prepend the provider name to the model_name when setting up your env variables, examples: 

- openai/gpt-4o-mini
- anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
- ollama/gemma2
- openrouter/nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct
- vertexai/gemini-1.5-flash-001
- gemini/gemini-1.5-flash-001

__There will be a UI configuration for models in the coming days.__

## Setup 2 models for more flexibility

There are 2 configurations for models at this point: 

```
DEFAULT_MODEL="openai/gpt-4o-mini"
SUMMARIZATION_MODEL="openrouter/nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct"
```

- **DEFAULT_MODEL** is used by the chat tool
- **SUMMARIZATION_MODEL (optional)** is used on the content summarization

The reason for opting for this route is because different LLMs, will behave better/worse depending on the type of request and type of tools offered. So it makes sense to build a more refined system to decide which model should process which task.

For instance, we can use an Ollama based model, like `gemma2` to do summarization and document query, and use openai/claude for the chat. The whole idea is to allow you to experiment on cost/performance.


## Running the app

After the app is running, you can access it at http://localhost:8080.

The first time you connect, it will check for the database and see if the schema is ready. If not, it will create the database for you. 

Go to the [Usage](USAGE.md) page to learn how to use all features.

## Upgrading Open Notebook

### Running from source

Just run `git pull` on the root project folder and then `poetry install` to update dependencies.

### Running from docker

Just pull the latest image with `docker pull lfnovo/open-notebook:latest` and restart your containers with `docker-compose up -d`
